# Personal Brand & Content

**Status:** Planning
**Started:** 2026

## My Unique Angle

> Epita student & web dev passionate about AI, cybersecurity, and software dev. Joined JECT to learn everything that comes *before* the dev part. Building a mailing list to document the journey and create a network of passionate tech people -- "iron sharpens iron."

*(Make FR + EN version, user's choice)*

## Content Actions

- [ ] Take a pro picture for my socials
- [ ] Plan Instagram posts (content calendar)
- [ ] Learn to create engaging content + monitor how well an Instagram post does
- [ ] Research: how to ensure my video ranks #1 on YouTube searches
- [ ] Explore idea: make videos future Epita students will watch -> become a guide
    - [ ] Try to remember / ask people about the searches I made about Epita, piscine, etc.

## Monetisation Ideas (backlog)

- [ ] Mailing list -> share learnings from JECT -> sell a course -> maybe un accompagnement for first clients
- [ ] Concours for free content -> admit everyone, give them the course, thank them for their time

## Platforms

- Instagram
- YouTube
- Mailing list (TBD)
