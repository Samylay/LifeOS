# JECT - Junior Enterprise

**Status:** Active
**Role:** Member
**Started:** 2026

## Why

Joined JECT to learn everything that comes *before* the dev part -- client relations, project scoping, sales framing, ops. Building real-world experience beyond pure coding.

## Connaissance & Positionnement

- [ ] Get insanely familiar with what we offer: past projects, timelines, costs
- [ ] Define the profiles we want to hire inside the JE
- [ ] Understand why companies/individuals use a JE -> find where they gather -> redirect to our AI assessing tool
- [ ] Learn to reverse engineer the JECT way (likely how tools like Infinity, Pegasus, etc. are built)
- [ ] When talking to a client: frame website as = more clients, emphasize SEO value

## Projects & Ops

- [x] Proposer a Killian de dev des bots Discord pour la JECT
- [ ] n8n automation for JECT content creation
- [ ] Template for site vitrine with CMS integrations
- [ ] Add photos to Lyna's site + logo + fix website description (refer to insta conv)

## Notes

- Sales angle: website = more clients, SEO is the key value prop
- Look into AI assessing tool as lead gen funnel
